  <h1>About Jim's Mowing</h1>
  <p>Started in British Columbia in 1997 by a dedicated Canadian family, Jim's Mowing Canada grew from just one single franchise to now more than 63 franchises servicing customers across all areas of British Columbia. Jim's Mowing Franchisees maintain gardens and lawns from Lower Mainland, from the South to the North on Vancouver Island, as well as in the Interior.</p>

  <p>Jim's Mowing Canada spun off from the Jim's Mowing business originally started by Jim Penman in Australia in 1992, and has since expanded here to Canada, as well as New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Jim's Mowing now has in excess of 1900 franchises, who run their own mowing and gardening businesses with the support and guidance of the largest lawn mowing and garden maintenance franchise systems in the world - so large in fact that the Jim's Group globally now comprises over 50 divisions and 4,000 franchisees. </p>
